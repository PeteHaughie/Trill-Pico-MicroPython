# Trill-Pico-Py

I did not write this implementation, it was abstracted out from the awesome work by [Grumpy Mike](https://github.com/Grumpy-Mike/Mikes-Pi-Bakery/) for his Pi Pico Trill guitar project. I thought it deserved to be dragged out of the giant MagPi project repository to make it easier for others to start playing with the Trill sensor family and Pi Pico.
